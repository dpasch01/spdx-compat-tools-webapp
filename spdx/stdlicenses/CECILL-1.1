 FREE SOFTWARE LICENSING AGREEMENT CeCILL 
<p>Notice</p>
<p>This Agreement is a free software license that is the result of discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with the two main principles guiding its drafting: <br/>
 - firstly, its conformity with French law, both as regards the law of torts and intellectual property law, and the protection that it offers to authors and the holders of economic rights over software. <br/>
 - secondly, compliance with the principles for the distribution of free software: access to source codes, extended user-rights.</p>
<p>The following bodies are the authors of this license CeCILL (Ce : CEA, C : CNRS, I : INRIA, LL : Logiciel Libre):</p>
<p>Commissariat à l&apos;Energie Atomique - CEA, a public scientific, technical and industrial establishment, having its principal place of business at 31-33 rue de la Fédération, 75752 PARIS cedex 15, France.</p>

<p>PREAMBLE</p>
<p>The purpose of this Free Software Licensing Agreement is to grant users the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this license within the framework of an &quot;open source&quot; distribution model.</p>
<p>The exercising of these rights is conditional upon certain obligations for users so as to ensure that this status is retained for subsequent redistribution operations.</p>
<p>As a counterpart to the access to the source code and rights to copy, modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only with a limited warranty and the software&apos;s author, the holder of the economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.</p>
<p>In this respect, it is brought to the user&apos;s attention that the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user given its nature of Free Software, that may mean that it is complicated to manipulate, and that also therefore means that it is reserved for developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the Software&apos;s suitability as regards their requirements in conditions enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and, more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published, provided it is not altered, and that no Articles are either added or removed herefrom. </p>
<p>This Agreement may apply to any or all software for which the holder of the economic rights decides to submit the operation thereof to its provisions. </p>

In this respect, the Licensee&apos;s attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using, modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software that are reserved for experienced users.</p>
<p>The Licensee shall be responsible for verifying, by any or all means, the product&apos;s suitability for its requirements, its due and proper functioning, and for ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons or property.</p>

<p>Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free from any or all error, that it shall operate continuously, that it shall be compatible with the Licensee&apos;s own equipment and its software configuration, nor that it shall meet the Licensee&apos;s requirements.</p>
<p>9.4. The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the Software does not infringe any or all third party intellectual right relating to a patent, software or to any or all other property right. Moreover, the Licensor shall not hold the Licensee harmless against any or all proceedings for infringement that may be instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal assistance for its defense. Such technical and legal assistance shall be decided upon on a case-by-case basis between the relevant Licensor and the Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor disclaims any or all liability as regards the Licensee&apos;s use of the Software&apos;s name. No warranty shall be provided as regards the existence of prior rights over the name of the Software and as regards the existence of a trademark. </p>

<p>10.2. The Licensee whose Agreement is terminated shall no longer be authorized to use, modify or distribute the Software. However, any or all licenses that it may have granted prior to termination of the Agreement shall remain valid subject to their having been granted in compliance with the terms and conditions hereof. </p>
<p>Article 11 - MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS  </p>
<p>11.1. EXCUSABLE EVENTS</p>

<p>11.2. The fact that either Party may fail, on one or several occasions, to invoke one or several of the provisions hereof, shall under no circumstances be interpreted as being a waiver by the interested Party of its entitlement to invoke said provision(s) subsequently.</p>
<p>11.3. The Agreement cancels and replaces any or all previous agreement, whether written or oral, between the Parties and having the same purpose, and constitutes the entirety of the agreement between said Parties concerning said purpose. No supplement or modification to the terms and conditions hereof shall be effective as regards the Parties unless it is made in writing and signed by their duly authorized representatives.</p>
<p>11.4. In the event that one or several of the provisions hereof were to conflict with a current or future applicable act or legislative text, said act or legislative text shall take precedence, and the Parties shall make the necessary amendments so as to be in compliance with said act or legislative text. All the other provisions shall remain effective. Similarly, the fact that a provision of the Agreement may be null and void, for any reason whatsoever, shall not cause the Agreement as a whole to be null and void.</p>

These subsequent versions may address new issues encountered by Free Software.</p>
<p>12.3. Any or all Software distributed under a given version of the Agreement may only be subsequently distributed under the same version of the Agreement, or a subsequent version, subject to the provisions of article 5.3.4. </p>
<p>Article 13 - GOVERNING LAW AND JURISDICTION  </p>
<p>13.1. The Agreement is governed by French law. The Parties agree to endeavor to settle the disagreements or disputes that may arise during the performance of the Agreement out-of-court.</p>
