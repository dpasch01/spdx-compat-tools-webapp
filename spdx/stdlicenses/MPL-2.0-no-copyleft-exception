<p>2. License Grants and Conditions<br/>
--------------------------------</p>
<p>2.1. Grants</p>
<p>Each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, royalty-free,<br/>
non-exclusive license:</p>
<p>(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent or trademark)<br/>
    Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available,<br/>
    modify, display, perform, distribute, and otherwise exploit its<br/>
    Contributions, either on an unmodified basis, with Modifications, or<br/>
    as part of a Larger Work; and</p>
<p>(b) under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer<br/>
    for sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its<br/>
    Contributions or its Contributor Version.</p>
<p>2.2. Effective Date</p>
<p>The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution<br/>
become effective for each Contribution on the date the Contributor first<br/>
distributes such Contribution.</p>
<p>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</p>
<p>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under<br/>
this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the<br/>
distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.<br/>
Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a<br/>
Contributor:</p>
<p>(a) for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;<br/>
    or</p>
<p>(b) for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party&apos;s<br/>
    modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its<br/>
    Contributions with other software (except as part of its Contributor<br/>
    Version); or</p>
<p>(c) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of<br/>
    its Contributions.</p>
<p>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,<br/>
or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with<br/>
the notice requirements in Section 3.4).</p>
<p>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</p>
<p>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to<br/>
distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this<br/>
License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if<br/>
permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).</p>
<p>2.5. Representation</p>
<p>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its<br/>
Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights<br/>
to grant the rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</p>
<p>2.6. Fair Use</p>
<p>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under<br/>
applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other<br/>
equivalents.</p>
<p>2.7. Conditions</p>
<p>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted<br/>
in Section 2.1.</p>
<p>3. Responsibilities<br/>
-------------------</p>
<p>3.1. Distribution of Source Form</p>
<p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any<br/>
Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under<br/>
the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source<br/>
Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this<br/>
License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not<br/>
attempt to alter or restrict the recipients&apos; rights in the Source Code<br/>
Form.</p>
<p>3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</p>
<p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>
<p>(a) such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code<br/>
    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of<br/>
    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code<br/>
    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more<br/>
    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and</p>
<p>(b) You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this<br/>
    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the<br/>
    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter<br/>
    the recipients&apos; rights in the Source Code Form under this License.</p>
<p>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</p>
<p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,<br/>
provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for<br/>
the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered<br/>
Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the<br/>
Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this<br/>
License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software<br/>
under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of<br/>
the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered<br/>
Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary<br/>
License(s).</p>
<p>3.4. Notices</p>
<p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices<br/>
(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,<br/>
or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of<br/>
the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to<br/>
the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.</p>
<p>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</p>
<p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,<br/>
indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered<br/>
Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on<br/>
behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any<br/>
such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by<br/>
You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any<br/>
liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,<br/>
indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional<br/>
disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any<br/>
jurisdiction.</p>
<p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation<br/>
---------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this<br/>
License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to<br/>
statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with<br/>
the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and (b)<br/>
describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must<br/>
be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered<br/>
Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute<br/>
or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a<br/>
recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>
<p>5. Termination<br/>
--------------</p>
<p>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically<br/>
if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become<br/>
compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular<br/>
Contributor are reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until such<br/>
Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and (b) on an<br/>
ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the<br/>
non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have<br/>
come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular<br/>
Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor<br/>
notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the<br/>
first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License<br/>
from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after<br/>
Your receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent<br/>
infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,<br/>
counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version<br/>
directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to<br/>
You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section<br/>
2.1 of this License shall terminate.</p>
<p>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all<br/>
end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which<br/>
have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License<br/>
prior to termination shall survive termination.</p>

*  Covered Software is provided under this License on an &quot;as is&quot;       *<br/>
*  basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or  *<br/>
*  statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the       *<br/>
*  Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a        *<br/>
*  particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the     *<br/>
*  quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.        *<br/>
*  Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You     *<br/>
*  (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,   *<br/>
*  repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an   *<br/>
*  essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is   *<br/>
*  authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.         *<br/>
*                                                                      *<br/>

*  7. Limitation of Liability                                          *<br/>

*                                                                      *<br/>
*  Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort      *<br/>
*  (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any           *<br/>
*  Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as          *<br/>

*  special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character      *<br/>
*  including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of    *<br/>

*  and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party      *<br/>
*  shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This   *<br/>
*  limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or   *<br/>
*  personal injury resulting from such party&apos;s negligence to the       *<br/>
*  extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some               *<br/>
*  jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of           *<br/>
*  incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and          *<br/>
*  limitation may not apply to You.                                    *<br/>
*                                                                      *<br/>
************************************************************************</p>
<p>8. Litigation<br/>
-------------</p>
<p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the<br/>
courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal<br/>
place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that<br/>
jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.<br/>
Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party&apos;s ability to bring<br/>
cross-claims or counter-claims.</p>
<p>9. Miscellaneous<br/>
----------------</p>
<p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject<br/>
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be<br/>
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent<br/>
necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides<br/>
that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter<br/>
shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.</p>
<p>10. Versions of the License<br/>
---------------------------</p>
<p>10.1. New Versions</p>
<p>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section<br/>
10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or<br/>
publish new versions of this License. Each version will be given a<br/>
distinguishing version number.</p>
<p>10.2. Effect of New Versions</p>
<p>You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version<br/>
of the License under which You originally received the Covered Software,<br/>
or under the terms of any subsequent version published by the license<br/>
steward.</p>
<p>10.3. Modified Versions</p>
<p>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to<br/>
create a new license for such software, you may create and use a<br/>
modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove<br/>
any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that<br/>
such modified license differs from this License).</p>
<p>10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary<br/>
Licenses</p>
<p>If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With<br/>
Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the<br/>
notice described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.</p>
